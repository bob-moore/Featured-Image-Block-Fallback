If you'd like to submit it to the repository yourself and provide support, feel free to fork it!  <\/p>\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions<\/h2>\n<h3><strong>Is this plugin available on the official WordPress plugin repository?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>No, this plugin is distributed via GitHub only. If you\u2019d like to submit it to the repository and maintain support, you\u2019re welcome to fork it.  <\/p>\n<h3><strong>Will I receive updates?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Yes. Updates are pushed directly from <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bob-moore\/Featured-Image-Block-Fallback\">GitHub<\/a> instead of the WordPress Plugin Repository.  <\/p>\n<h3><strong>Can I set a different fallback image for different post types?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Yes! Since the fallback image is set directly on the block itself, you can assign different fallback images for each query, loop, or post template where the <code>core\/post-featured-image<\/code> block is used.  <\/p>\n<p>Additionally, developers can customize the fallback image dynamically using the <code>featured_image_block_fallback_id<\/code> filter. Here\u2019s an example of how to set a different fallback image for a specific post type:  <\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-php\">\/**\n * Fallback image ID filter.\n *\n * @param int   $fallback_id The fallback image ID.\n * @param array $block The block attributes.\n *\n * @return int The fallback image ID.\n *\/\nfunction my_theme_featured_image_fallback( int $fallback_id, array $block ): int\n{\n    if ( get_post_type( get_the_ID() ) === 'my-custom-post-type' ) {\n        $fallback_id = 123; \/\/ Replace with your fallback image ID.\n    }\n\n    return $fallback_id;\n}\nadd_filter( 'featured_image_block_fallback_id', 'my_theme_featured_image_fallback', 10, 2 );<\/code><\/pre>",
